## What You'll Build

A system of AI agents that promote your newsletter across four social channels every single day. X, LinkedIn, Facebook groups, and Reddit. Each channel gets its own agent with its own strategy. You write the newsletter. The agents handle distribution, engagement, and discovery.

This isn't "blast your link everywhere." Each channel requires a different approach, and the agents are built to match. Thoughtful posts on X and LinkedIn. Genuine helpful comments in Facebook groups. Value-first contributions on Reddit that happen to mention your newsletter when it's relevant.

## Why This Works

Most newsletter creators have the same problem: they're great at writing but terrible at promotion. You publish an issue, share it once on Twitter, maybe post on LinkedIn, and then go back to writing the next one. Meanwhile, the issue gets seen by maybe 10% of the people who'd actually want it.

The math is brutal. A newsletter needs subscribers to survive. Subscribers come from visibility. Visibility requires showing up consistently across multiple channels. That's a full-time job on top of actually writing the newsletter.

Hiring a social media manager costs $2-4K/month. Most newsletter creators are bootstrapped. The gap between "I need to promote this" and "I can afford to promote this" is where newsletters go to die.

AI agents close that gap. Four agents, each running on a schedule, each doing the kind of engagement that actually drives signups. Total cost: $20-50/month in API fees plus a few hours of setup.

## The 4-Channel Strategy

Each channel plays a different role in your growth funnel.

### Channel 1: X (Twitter)

**Role:** Build in public, share insights, stay visible in your niche.

**What the agent does:**
- Drafts 2-3 posts per day based on what you're working on, industry trends, or newsletter content
- Sends drafts to you for review (you pick which ones to post)
- Repurposes newsletter content into standalone posts and threads
- Monitors trending topics in your space and suggests timely takes

**Why it works:** X is where you build a personal brand around your newsletter's topic. People subscribe to newsletters from people they follow and trust. Consistent posting keeps you visible without you spending hours scrolling.

**Setup:**
1. Create an agent with access to a scheduling tool (Typefully, Buffer, or direct API posting)
2. Give it a voice guide that matches how you actually write
3. Set a cron job to draft posts hourly during your audience's active hours
4. Review and approve from your phone in under 5 minutes

**Key rule:** Never auto-publish. Review everything. Your name is on it.

### Channel 2: LinkedIn

**Role:** Reach professionals who don't hang out on X.

**What the agent does:**
- Adapts your X content for LinkedIn's format (longer, more context, professional framing)
- Drafts original LinkedIn posts from your newsletter content
- Targets the "I'm curious about this topic but don't know where to start" audience

**Why it works:** LinkedIn's algorithm rewards consistent posting more than any other platform right now. Your newsletter content is already written. The agent just repackages it for a different audience. A lot of newsletter subscribers come from LinkedIn and never touch X.

**Setup:**
1. Same scheduling tool as X (most support both platforms)
2. Separate voice guide for LinkedIn (slightly more professional, longer form, but still conversational)
3. Post once per day, ideally mornings on weekdays
4. Always include a soft CTA: "I write about this every week" with a link

**Key rule:** LinkedIn posts should stand alone as valuable content. The newsletter link is a bonus, not the point.

### Channel 3: Facebook Groups

**Role:** Be the helpful expert in communities where your audience already hangs out.

**What the agent does:**
- Joins 5-7 Facebook groups relevant to your newsletter's topic
- Scans recent posts nightly for questions, discussions, and problems you can help with
- Drafts helpful comments in your voice
- Mentions your newsletter only when genuinely relevant (2-3 times per night out of 20+ comments)

**Why it works:** Facebook groups are underrated for newsletter growth. They're full of people actively asking questions about your topic. A genuine, helpful comment from someone who clearly knows what they're talking about builds trust fast. When you mention your newsletter in that context, it doesn't feel like spam. It feels like a resource.

**Setup:**
1. Create an agent with browser automation access (OpenClaw's browser relay works well here)
2. Configure it to scroll through each group, identify posts worth commenting on
3. Build a dedup system so it never comments on the same post twice
4. Schedule it to run overnight (comments posted at off-hours still get seen)
5. Track which groups perform best and rotate accordingly

**What makes a good comment:**
- Answers a specific question with real advice
- Shares relevant experience ("I ran into this too, here's what worked...")
- Short paragraphs, conversational tone
- No "Hope this helps!" or "Great question!" filler

**What to skip:**
- Memes and humor posts
- Posts with 50+ comments already (you'll get buried)
- Admin announcements
- Anything older than 3 days

**Key rule:** The ratio matters. At least 80% of your comments should be pure value with zero self-promotion. You're building a reputation, not running ads.

### Channel 4: Reddit

**Role:** Long-term credibility play in niche communities.

**What the agent does:**
- Monitors 10-15 subreddits where your audience hangs out
- Finds threads where you can add genuine value
- Drafts comments in a casual, Reddit-native voice
- Occasionally mentions your newsletter when it's directly relevant

**Why it works:** Reddit is the hardest channel to crack but the highest-quality subscribers come from it. People who find you through a helpful Reddit comment are exactly the kind of engaged readers who open every issue.

**Setup requires patience:**
1. Start with a karma-building phase. Two weeks of pure value comments, zero self-promotion. This is non-negotiable. Reddit communities will bury you if you show up on day one dropping links.
2. Create an agent that drafts comments but doesn't post automatically. You review and post manually (Reddit's bot detection is aggressive).
3. After karma building, mix in newsletter mentions at a 70/30 ratio. 70% pure value, 30% with a natural link.
4. Rotate subreddits so you're not hitting the same community too often.

**Subreddit selection:**
- 3-5 primary subs directly related to your topic
- 3-5 secondary subs in adjacent topics
- 2-3 casual/hobby subs to look like a real person (because you are)

**Key rule:** Reddit takes weeks to pay off. Don't expect day-one results. But the subscribers who find you through Reddit have the highest retention rates of any channel.

## The Daily Workflow

Here's what your day actually looks like once this is running:

**Morning (10 minutes):**
- Review overnight Facebook group comments (already posted by agent)
- Check X/LinkedIn drafts, approve 2-3 for the day
- Glance at Reddit opportunities the agent flagged

**Throughout the day:**
- X posts go out on schedule
- LinkedIn post publishes in the morning
- You respond to any replies or engagement on your posts (this part is still you)

**Evening (5 minutes):**
- Review next batch of Reddit comment drafts
- Post 2-3 Reddit comments manually

**Overnight:**
- Facebook group agent runs its nightly cycle
- Research agents scan for tomorrow's opportunities

Total daily time: 15-20 minutes of review and approval. The agents handle the grunt work of finding opportunities, drafting content, and maintaining consistency.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Pick Your Primary Channel

Don't set up all four at once. Pick the channel where your audience is most active.

- B2B / professional audience → start with LinkedIn
- Tech / startup audience → start with X
- Consumer / hobbyist audience → start with Facebook groups
- Niche / technical audience → start with Reddit

### Step 2: Build the Content Engine

Before any social posting works, you need content to draw from. Your newsletter is the source material. Set up an agent that:

1. Reads your latest newsletter issue
2. Extracts 5-10 standalone insights, tips, or talking points
3. Reformats each one for the target platform
4. Saves drafts for your review

This agent runs once per newsletter issue. It's the engine that feeds all four channels.

### Step 3: Set Up Scheduling

For X and LinkedIn, use a scheduling tool with an API:
- Typefully, Buffer, or direct platform APIs
- The agent creates drafts in the tool, you approve from the app

For Facebook and Reddit, use browser automation:
- OpenClaw's browser relay connects to a real browser session
- The agent navigates, reads, and comments like a human would

### Step 4: Build the Comment Engine

For Facebook groups and Reddit, the approach is different from posting. You're not broadcasting. You're participating.

Create an agent that:
1. Scans target communities for recent posts (last 24-48 hours)
2. Identifies posts where you can add value
3. Drafts comments in your voice
4. Tracks which posts it's already commented on (never double-comment)
5. Logs everything for your review

### Step 5: Set Schedules and Let It Run

- X drafts: hourly during active hours
- LinkedIn: one draft per morning
- Facebook comments: nightly batch
- Reddit: daily opportunity scan, you post manually

### Step 6: Add Channels One at a Time

Once your first channel is running smoothly (give it 2 weeks), add the second. Then the third. Each one takes a few hours to configure and a week to tune.

## What to Expect

**Week 1-2:** You're mostly tuning agent instructions. The drafts won't be perfect. You'll reject half of them and rewrite the other half. This is normal. You're training the agents on your voice.

**Week 3-4:** The agents start producing drafts you can approve with minor edits. Your posting consistency goes way up. You might not see subscriber growth yet, but you're building the foundation.

**Month 2:** Posting is on autopilot. You're spending 15-20 minutes a day instead of 2 hours. Subscriber growth starts compounding as your presence across channels builds.

**Month 3+:** The flywheel kicks in. People see you on X, then find you in a Facebook group, then see your Reddit comment, then subscribe. Multi-channel presence creates the impression that you're everywhere, which builds trust faster than any single channel.

**Realistic numbers:** Every newsletter and niche is different. But consistent multi-channel presence typically doubles or triples organic subscriber growth compared to "post when I remember" mode. The compounding effect of daily visibility across four channels is hard to replicate manually.

## Gotchas and Tips

- **Voice consistency matters more than volume.** Ten posts that sound like you beats fifty that sound like ChatGPT. Invest time in your voice guides.
- **Facebook groups are the most underrated channel.** Most newsletter creators ignore them entirely. The engagement-to-effort ratio is excellent.
- **Reddit is a long game.** If you start dropping links on day one, you'll get banned. Karma building isn't optional.
- **Never auto-publish anything with your name on it.** Always review. Always approve. The agents handle the 80% that's research and drafting. You handle the 20% that's judgment.
- **Track what works.** Note which channels drive actual signups, not just impressions. Double down on what converts.
- **Rotate your content angles.** The same insight can be framed differently for X (punchy observation), LinkedIn (professional lesson), Facebook (helpful tip), and Reddit (detailed answer). One newsletter issue can fuel a week of content across all four channels.
- **Don't neglect the replies.** When people respond to your posts or comments, reply back. That's where relationships form. The agents get you into conversations. You close them.
